"""
My Contacts
CS50 Final Project
------------------

Author: Mosaddag Awad
Description:
    A simple command-line contact manager built with Python.
    The program allows users to:
      - Add new contacts (name and phone number)
      - View all saved contacts
      - Search for a contact by name
      - Delete a contact
      - Exit the program

    All data is stored in a local CSV file (contacts.csv)
    so that contacts remain saved even after the program exits.

Technologies Used:
    - Python 3
    - CSV File Handling
    - Basic Input/Output
    - Control Structures (if/else, loops, functions)

How to Run:
    1. Open the terminal in the project folder.
    2. Run the command: python3 contacts.py
    3. Follow the on-screen menu options.

CS50 Requirements:
    This project demonstrates file handling, user input, and logic flow ‚Äî
    covering the fundamentals required for the final project.
