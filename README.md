# My Contacts 📱  
### CS50 Final Project by Mosaddag Awad

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**My Contacts** is a simple command-line contact manager built in Python.  
It allows users to **store, search, view, and delete** contact information directly from the terminal.  

This project demonstrates practical programming skills including:
- File handling with CSV files
- Loops and conditional statements
- User input and data validation
- Modular function design
- Persistent data storage

## 🧠 Motivation

The idea behind *My Contacts* came from the need for a lightweight and easy-to-use tool to organize names and phone numbers.  
Unlike mobile apps, this tool is purely text-based — great for practicing Python fundamentals and logical thinking.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **Add Contact** — Add a new name and phone number to your list.  
✅ **View All Contacts** — Display all stored contacts in a clean table.  
✅ **Search Contact** — Find a contact by name instantly.  
✅ **Delete Contact** — Remove a contact from your list permanently.  
✅ **Data Persistence** — Contacts are saved in a CSV file (`contacts.csv`), so they remain even after closing the program.
